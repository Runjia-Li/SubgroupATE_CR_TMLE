# Folder stucture:
"CodeExample.R" -- code example for demonstrating subgroup ATE estimation using the proposed TMLE method and other methods in comparison;
                 run this code and call functions to 1. generate example data; 2. estimate the subgroup ATE
"functions/SimuData2model.R" -- function for generating the data example (time-to-event with competing risks)
"functions/SubgroupATE_CR_TMLE.R" -- functions including flexible TMLE methods,  S- and T-learners, One-step estimators for 
      time-to-event data with competing risks
"DataExample.csv" -- data example for demonstrating the proposed TMLE method and other methods in comparison, generated by calling "functions/SimuData2model.R" 
A: the binary treatment
event.time: event time
event.type: event type, 1 = primary event, 2 = competing event, 0 =  censored
Z.1 - Z.10: baseline covariates, Z.1 and Z.3 are predictive variables, the rest are prognostic variables
Inter.1 - Inter 10: the interaction terms between covariates and treatment
